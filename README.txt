1. Copy all files to the correct folder you use to host your websites in.
2. Create a new database called "worksample" (you could name it to whatever you want).
3. In the root folder there is a file called .env change so that it has your correct mysql-DB info.
4. Under config folder edit the file called "database.php", change so that it has your correct mysql-DB info.
5. Start command prompt and go to the root folder of your worksample site, type "php artisan migrate".
6. Done!
